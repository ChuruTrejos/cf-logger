To get started run with ```docker-compose up -d --build```. This will build out the containers for a local development environment. 

_Note: You must have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system._

ColdFusion does no longer include the MySQL connector.  the MySQL-Connector-Java is available under \APP to install in the \coldfusion\cfusion\lib folder
